## Introduction

Integration is a fundamental tool for quantifying accumulation, area, and change. In AI/ML and data science, integration is used in probability, statistics, signal processing, and to compute expectations, areas under curves (such as ROC/AUC), and more. This section explores practical applications of integration, with a focus on mathematical rigor, intuition, and real-world relevance.

## 5.1 Area Between Curves

### Mathematical Foundations

The area between two curves \( y = f(x) \) and \( y = g(x) \) over an interval \([a, b]\) is given by:
\[
A = \int_a^b |f(x) - g(x)| \, dx
\]
If \( f(x) \geq g(x) \) on \([a, b]\), then:
\[
A = \int_a^b (f(x) - g(x)) \, dx
\]
This measures the net "vertical distance" between the curves, and is widely used in probability (e.g., comparing distributions), economics, and model evaluation (e.g., AUC in classification).

**Relevance to AI/ML:**
- Calculating the area under a curve (AUC) is a standard metric for classifier performance.
- Integrals are used to compute expected values, probabilities, and normalization constants in probabilistic models.
- Visualizing areas helps interpret model predictions and data distributions.

### Python Implementation: Area Between Curves

The following code demonstrates how to compute and visualize the area between two curves, with step-by-step commentary.

**Explanation:**
- The functions are defined symbolically, allowing for exact intersection and area calculations.
- The area is computed as the definite integral of the difference between the upper and lower functions.
- Visualization highlights the region of interest, making the concept of "area between curves" concrete.
- This approach is directly applicable to evaluating model performance (AUC), comparing distributions, and more in AI/ML.
