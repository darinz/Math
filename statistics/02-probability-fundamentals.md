## Introduction

Probability theory is the mathematical foundation for statistics, machine learning, and data science. Understanding probability concepts is essential for making informed decisions under uncertainty. In today's data-driven world, probability provides the language and tools to quantify uncertainty, model randomness, and make predictions about future events.

### Why Probability Matters in Data Science

Probability theory serves as the backbone of modern data science and artificial intelligence:

1. **Uncertainty Quantification**: Every real-world decision involves uncertainty, and probability provides the mathematical framework to quantify and manage this uncertainty
2. **Statistical Inference**: Probability enables us to draw conclusions from sample data about populations
3. **Machine Learning**: Most machine learning algorithms are built on probabilistic foundations
4. **Risk Assessment**: Probability helps evaluate risks in finance, medicine, engineering, and other fields
5. **Decision Making**: Bayesian decision theory provides a framework for optimal decision-making under uncertainty

### The Role of Probability in Modern AI/ML

Probability theory is fundamental to modern artificial intelligence and machine learning:

- **Bayesian Networks**: Graphical models that represent probabilistic relationships

## Basic Probability Concepts

Probability provides a mathematical framework for quantifying uncertainty. It allows us to make predictions and decisions in the face of incomplete information.

### Understanding Uncertainty

Uncertainty is a fundamental aspect of the world around us. From weather forecasting to medical diagnosis, from financial markets to scientific experiments, we constantly face situations where outcomes are not deterministic. Probability theory provides the mathematical language to describe and reason about this uncertainty.

#### Types of Uncertainty

1. **Aleatory Uncertainty**: Inherent randomness in the system (e.g., quantum mechanics, radioactive decay)
2. **Epistemic Uncertainty**: Uncertainty due to lack of knowledge (e.g., unknown parameters, measurement errors)
3. **Model Uncertainty**: Uncertainty about the mathematical model itself
4. **Parameter Uncertainty**: Uncertainty about the values of model parameters

### Sample Space and Events

**Sample Space (Î©)**: The set of all possible outcomes of an experiment.

**Event**: A subset of the sample space.

**Mathematical Definition:**
- Sample Space: $`\Omega = \{\omega_1, \omega_2, \ldots, \omega_n\}`$
- Event A: $`A \subseteq \Omega`$
- Probability Function: $`P: 2^{\Omega} \rightarrow [0,1]`$ satisfying:
  1. $`P(\Omega) = 1`$ (certainty)
  2. $`P(A) \geq 0`$ for all $`A \subseteq \Omega`$ (non-negativity)
  3. $`P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)`$ if $`A \cap B = \emptyset`$ (additivity for disjoint events)

#### Intuitive Understanding

Think of the sample space as a "universe" of all possible outcomes. An event is any collection of outcomes we're interested in. The probability function assigns a number between 0 and 1 to each event, representing our degree of belief that the event will occur.

#### Example: Coin Toss

- Sample Space: $`\Omega = \{H, T\}`$ (Heads, Tails)
- Events: $`\{H\}`$, $`\{T\}`$, $`\{H, T\}`$, $`\emptyset`$
- Probability: $`P(\{H\}) = 0.5`$, $`P(\{T\}) = 0.5`$, $`P(\{H, T\}) = 1`$, $`P(\emptyset) = 0`$

#### Example: Rolling a Die

- Sample Space: $`\Omega = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}`$
- Events: $`A = \{1, 3, 5\}`$ (odd numbers), $`B = \{2, 4, 6\}`$ (even numbers)
- Probability: $`P(A) = 0.5`$, $`P(B) = 0.5`$, $`P(A \cap B) = 0`$ (disjoint events)

#### Properties of Probability

1. **Complement Rule**: $`P(A^c) = 1 - P(A)`$
2. **Inclusion-Exclusion**: $`P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)`$
3. **Monotonicity**: If $`A \subseteq B`$, then $`P(A) \leq P(B)`$
4. **Subadditivity**: $`P(A \cup B) \leq P(A) + P(B)`$

#### Example: Inclusion-Exclusion Principle

Consider drawing a card from a standard deck:
- Event A: Drawing a heart ($`P(A) = \frac{13}{52} = \frac{1}{4}`$)
- Event B: Drawing a face card ($`P(B) = \frac{12}{52} = \frac{3}{13}`$)
- Event $`A \cap B`$: Drawing a heart that's also a face card ($`P(A \cap B) = \frac{3}{52}`$)
- Event $`A \cup B`$: Drawing a heart or a face card
- $`P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B) = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{3}{13} - \frac{3}{52} = \frac{22}{52} = \frac{11}{26}`$

### Conditional Probability

**Conditional Probability** measures the probability of an event given that another event has occurred. It represents how our beliefs about an event change when we receive new information.

#### Mathematical Definition

```math
P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} \quad \text{where } P(B) > 0
```

#### Intuitive Understanding

Conditional probability can be thought of as "updating" our beliefs based on new information. If we know that event B has occurred, we restrict our attention to the outcomes in B and ask what fraction of those outcomes also belong to A.

#### Example: Medical Diagnosis

Consider a medical test for a disease:
- Event D: Person has the disease ($`P(D) = 0.01`$)
- Event T: Test is positive
- $`P(T|D) = 0.95`$ (sensitivity: 95% of diseased people test positive)
- $`P(T|D^c) = 0.05`$ (false positive rate: 5% of healthy people test positive)

What is $`P(D|T)`$, the probability of having the disease given a positive test?

Using Bayes' theorem (which we'll discuss later):
```math
P(D|T) = \frac{P(T|D)P(D)}{P(T|D)P(D) + P(T|D^c)P(D^c)} = \frac{0.95 \times 0.01}{0.95 \times 0.01 + 0.05 \times 0.99} \approx 0.16
```

This shows that even with a positive test, there's only about a 16% chance of actually having the disease!

#### Properties

1. **Range**: $`0 \leq P(A|B) \leq 1`$
2. **Normalization**: $`P(\Omega|B) = 1`$
3. **Additivity**: $`P(A \cup C|B) = P(A|B) + P(C|B)`$ if $`A \cap C = \emptyset`$
4. **Multiplication Rule**: $`P(A \cap B) = P(A|B) \times P(B)`$

#### Example: Multiplication Rule

Consider drawing two cards without replacement from a deck:
- Event A: First card is an ace
- Event B: Second card is an ace
- $`P(A) = \frac{4}{52} = \frac{1}{13}`$
- $`P(B|A) = \frac{3}{51}`$ (after drawing one ace, 3 aces remain out of 51 cards)
- $`P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B|A) = \frac{1}{13} \times \frac{3}{51} = \frac{1}{221}`$

### Independence

Two events A and B are **independent** if the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of the other. This is a fundamental concept in probability theory and has important implications for statistical modeling.

#### Mathematical Definition

Events A and B are independent if and only if:
```math
P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B)
```

#### Equivalent Definitions

1. $`P(A|B) = P(A)`$ (if $`P(B) > 0`$)
2. $`P(B|A) = P(B)`$ (if $`P(A) > 0`$)

#### Intuitive Understanding

Independence means that knowing whether one event occurred doesn't change our belief about the other event. This is different from being mutually exclusive (disjoint), which means the events cannot occur together.

#### Example: Independent Events

Consider flipping a fair coin twice:
- Event A: First flip is heads ($`P(A) = 0.5`$)
- Event B: Second flip is heads ($`P(B) = 0.5`$)
- Event $`A \cap B`$: Both flips are heads
- $`P(A \cap B) = 0.25 = P(A) \times P(B)`$

The events are independent because the outcome of the first flip doesn't affect the second flip.

#### Example: Dependent Events

Consider drawing two cards without replacement:
- Event A: First card is an ace ($`P(A) = \frac{4}{52}`$)
- Event B: Second card is an ace
- $`P(B|A) = \frac{3}{51} \neq P(B) = \frac{4}{52}`$

The events are dependent because drawing an ace first reduces the probability of drawing an ace second.

#### Properties

1. **Symmetry**: If A is independent of B, then B is independent of A
2. **Transitivity**: Independence is not transitive (A independent of B and B independent of C doesn't imply A independent of C)
3. **Complement**: If A and B are independent, then A and $`B^c`$ are independent
4. **Conditional Independence**: A and B may be independent given a third event C

#### Example: Conditional Independence

Consider three events in a medical context:
- A: Smoking
- B: Lung cancer
- C: Age

A and B are dependent (smoking affects cancer risk), but they might be conditionally independent given age (among people of the same age, smoking and cancer might be independent).

### Law of Total Probability

The **Law of Total Probability** allows us to calculate the probability of an event by conditioning on a partition of the sample space. This is a powerful tool for breaking complex problems into simpler parts.

#### Mathematical Definition

If $`B_1, B_2, \ldots, B_n`$ form a partition of $`\Omega`$ (i.e., they are mutually exclusive and exhaustive), then:
```math
P(A) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} P(A|B_i) \times P(B_i)
```

#### Special Case (Two Events)

```math
P(A) = P(A|B) \times P(B) + P(A|B^c) \times P(B^c)
```

#### Intuitive Understanding

The Law of Total Probability says that we can find the probability of an event by considering all the different ways it can occur. We break down the sample space into disjoint pieces, find the probability of our event within each piece, and then combine these probabilities.

#### Example: Quality Control

Consider a manufacturing process with two machines:
- Machine 1 produces 60% of items with 2% defect rate
- Machine 2 produces 40% of items with 5% defect rate

What is the overall defect rate?

Let A be the event "item is defective", Bâ be "item from Machine 1", Bâ be "item from Machine 2".

```math
P(A) = P(A|B_1)P(B_1) + P(A|B_2)P(B_2) = 0.02 \times 0.6 + 0.05 \times 0.4 = 0.032
```

The overall defect rate is 3.2%.

#### Applications

- **Medical diagnosis**: Combining test results with prior probabilities
- **Quality control**: Assessing overall defect rates from multiple sources
- **Risk assessment**: Combining risks from different scenarios
- **Bayesian inference**: Updating beliefs with new evidence

### Bayes' Theorem

**Bayes' Theorem** provides a way to update probabilities based on new evidence. It's one of the most important results in probability theory and has applications throughout statistics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.

#### Mathematical Definition

```math
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)}
```

Where $`P(B)`$ can be calculated using the Law of Total Probability:
```math
P(B) = P(B|A) \times P(A) + P(B|A^c) \times P(A^c)
```

#### Intuitive Understanding

Bayes' theorem tells us how to update our beliefs about an event A when we observe evidence B. The formula can be interpreted as:

```math
\text{Posterior} = \frac{\text{Likelihood} \times \text{Prior}}{\text{Evidence}}
```

- **Prior** $`P(A)`$: Our initial belief about A before seeing evidence
- **Likelihood** $`P(B|A)`$: How likely is the evidence given our hypothesis
- **Evidence** $`P(B)`$: Total probability of observing the evidence
- **Posterior** $`P(A|B)`$: Our updated belief about A after seeing evidence

#### Example: Medical Diagnosis Revisited

Using the medical test example from earlier:
- Prior: $`P(D) = 0.01`$ (1% of population has disease)
- Likelihood: $`P(T|D) = 0.95`$ (95% of diseased test positive)
- Evidence: $`P(T) = P(T|D)P(D) + P(T|D^c)P(D^c) = 0.95 \times 0.01 + 0.05 \times 0.99 = 0.059`$
- Posterior: $`P(D|T) = \frac{0.95 \times 0.01}{0.059} \approx 0.16`$

#### Applications

- **Medical diagnosis**: Updating disease probability based on test results
- **Spam filtering**: Updating spam probability based on email content
- **Machine learning**: Naive Bayes classifiers and Bayesian networks
- **Bayesian inference**: Statistical modeling with prior knowledge
- **Signal processing**: Updating signal estimates with new measurements

#### Example: Spam Filtering

Consider a simple spam filter:
- Prior: $`P(\text{Spam}) = 0.3`$ (30% of emails are spam)
- Likelihood: $`P(\text{"Free"}|\text{Spam}) = 0.8`$ (80% of spam contains "free")
- Likelihood: $`P(\text{"Free"}|\text{Not Spam}) = 0.1`$ (10% of legitimate emails contain "free")

What is $`P(\text{Spam}|\text{"Free"})`$?

```math
P(\text{Spam}|\text{"Free"}) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.3}{0.8 \times 0.3 + 0.1 \times 0.7} = \frac{0.24}{0.31} \approx 0.77
```

The email has about a 77% chance of being spam if it contains the word "free".

#### Properties of Bayesian Updating

1. **Prior Sensitivity**: The posterior depends heavily on the prior when evidence is weak
2. **Evidence Strength**: Strong evidence can overcome weak priors
3. **Sequential Updating**: We can update beliefs multiple times with new evidence
4. **Convergence**: With enough evidence, posteriors converge regardless of priors

#### Example: Sequential Updating

Consider updating our belief about a coin's fairness:
- Prior: $`P(\text{Fair}) = 0.5`$ (50% chance coin is fair)
- After 10 heads in a row: $`P(\text{Fair}|\text{10 heads}) \approx 0.001`$
- After 100 heads in a row: $`P(\text{Fair}|\text{100 heads}) \approx 0`$

The evidence becomes overwhelming, and our belief converges to certainty that the coin is biased. 

## Random Variables

A **random variable** is a function that assigns a numerical value to each outcome in a sample space. Random variables are the foundation for probability distributions and statistical modeling. They allow us to translate qualitative outcomes into quantitative analysis.

### Understanding Random Variables

Random variables bridge the gap between probability theory and statistics. They convert uncertain outcomes into numbers that we can analyze mathematically. This abstraction is powerful because it allows us to:

1. **Quantify Uncertainty**: Assign numerical values to uncertain events
2. **Apply Mathematical Tools**: Use calculus, algebra, and other mathematical techniques
3. **Compare Different Experiments**: Standardize outcomes across different contexts
4. **Build Models**: Create mathematical models of real-world phenomena

#### Intuitive Understanding

Think of a random variable as a "measurement" or "observation" that takes different values depending on the outcome of an experiment. For example:
- Rolling a die: $`X = \text{number on the die}`$
- Tossing a coin: $`X = 1`$ if heads, $`X = 0`$ if tails
- Measuring height: $`X = \text{height in centimeters}`$

#### Example: Coin Toss

Consider tossing a fair coin three times:
- Sample space: $`\Omega = \{HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT, THH, THT, TTH, TTT\}`$
- Random variable $`X = \text{number of heads}`$
- $`X(HHH) = 3`$, $`X(HHT) = 2`$, $`X(HTT) = 1`$, $`X(TTT) = 0`$, etc.

The random variable $`X`$ takes values in $`\{0, 1, 2, 3\}`$ with probabilities:
- $`P(X = 0) = \frac{1}{8}`$ (only TTT)
- $`P(X = 1) = \frac{3}{8}`$ (HTT, THT, TTH)
- $`P(X = 2) = \frac{3}{8}`$ (HHT, HTH, THH)
- $`P(X = 3) = \frac{1}{8}`$ (only HHH)

### Discrete Random Variables

A **discrete random variable** takes on a countable number of distinct values. These are the simplest type of random variables and form the foundation for understanding more complex continuous variables.

#### Mathematical Definition

A discrete random variable $`X`$ is a function $`X: \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R}`$ such that:
- The range of $`X`$ is countable (finite or countably infinite)
- For each $`x \in \mathbb{R}`$, the set $`\{\omega \in \Omega : X(\omega) = x\}`$ is an event

#### Probability Mass Function (PMF)

The probability mass function gives the probability that a discrete random variable takes on a specific value:

```math
p_X(x) = P(X = x)
```

#### Properties of PMF

1. $`p_X(x) \geq 0`$ for all $`x`$ (non-negativity)
2. $`\sum_{x} p_X(x) = 1`$ (normalization)
3. $`P(X \in A) = \sum_{x \in A} p_X(x)`$ (probability of any event)

#### Example: Bernoulli Distribution

The simplest discrete distribution models a single trial with two outcomes:
- $`X = 1`$ with probability $`p`$ (success)
- $`X = 0`$ with probability $`1-p`$ (failure)

PMF: $`p_X(x) = p^x(1-p)^{1-x}`$ for $`x \in \{0, 1\}`$

This models:
- Coin tosses (heads = 1, tails = 0)
- Medical tests (positive = 1, negative = 0)
- Quality control (defective = 1, good = 0)

#### Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)

The CDF gives the probability that a random variable takes on a value less than or equal to a given value:

```math
F_X(x) = P(X \leq x) = \sum_{k \leq x} p_X(k)
```

#### Properties of CDF

1. $`F_X(x)`$ is non-decreasing
2. $`\lim_{x \rightarrow -\infty} F_X(x) = 0`$
3. $`\lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} F_X(x) = 1`$
4. $`F_X(x)`$ is right-continuous
5. $`P(a < X \leq b) = F_X(b) - F_X(a)`$

#### Example: CDF of Bernoulli

For $`X \sim \text{Bernoulli}(p)`$:
- $`F_X(x) = 0`$ for $`x < 0`$
- $`F_X(x) = 1-p`$ for $`0 \leq x < 1`$
- $`F_X(x) = 1`$ for $`x \geq 1`$

#### Expected Value (Mean)

The expected value is the "average" value of a random variable, weighted by probabilities:

```math
\mu = E[X] = \sum_{x} x \cdot p_X(x)
```

#### Intuitive Understanding

The expected value represents the "center of mass" of the probability distribution. If we repeated the experiment many times, the average of the outcomes would approach the expected value.

#### Example: Expected Value of Bernoulli

For $`X \sim \text{Bernoulli}(p)`$:
```math
E[X] = 0 \cdot (1-p) + 1 \cdot p = p
```

The expected value equals the probability of success.

#### Variance

Variance measures the spread of a random variable around its mean:

```math
\sigma^2 = \text{Var}(X) = E[(X - \mu)^2] = \sum_{x} (x - \mu)^2 \cdot p_X(x)
```

#### Alternative Formula

For computational convenience:
```math
\text{Var}(X) = E[X^2] - (E[X])^2
```

#### Example: Variance of Bernoulli

For $`X \sim \text{Bernoulli}(p)`$:
- $`E[X^2] = 0^2 \cdot (1-p) + 1^2 \cdot p = p`$
- $`\text{Var}(X) = p - p^2 = p(1-p)`$

The variance is largest when $`p = 0.5`$ and decreases as $`p`$ approaches 0 or 1.

#### Moment Generating Function (MGF)

The moment generating function is a powerful tool for finding moments and proving properties of distributions:

```math
M_X(t) = E[e^{tX}] = \sum_{x} e^{tx} \cdot p_X(x)
```

#### Properties of MGF

1. **Moment Generation**: $`E[X^n] = M_X^{(n)}(0)`$ (nth derivative at 0)
2. **Uniqueness**: MGF uniquely determines the distribution
3. **Additivity**: If $`X`$ and $`Y`$ are independent, $`M_{X+Y}(t) = M_X(t)M_Y(t)`$

#### Example: MGF of Bernoulli

For $`X \sim \text{Bernoulli}(p)`$:
```math
M_X(t) = e^{t \cdot 0}(1-p) + e^{t \cdot 1}p = (1-p) + pe^t
```

To find moments:
- $`M_X'(t) = pe^t`$, so $`E[X] = M_X'(0) = p`$
- $`M_X''(t) = pe^t`$, so $`E[X^2] = M_X''(0) = p`$

#### Properties of Expected Value

1. **Linearity**: $`E[aX + b] = aE[X] + b`$
2. **Additivity**: $`E[X + Y] = E[X] + E[Y]`$ (always true)
3. **Independence**: $`E[XY] = E[X]E[Y]`$ (if $`X`$, $`Y`$ are independent)
4. **Monotonicity**: If $`X \leq Y`$, then $`E[X] \leq E[Y]`$

#### Properties of Variance

1. **Non-negativity**: $`\text{Var}(X) \geq 0`$
2. **Scale**: $`\text{Var}(aX + b) = a^2\text{Var}(X)`$
3. **Additivity**: $`\text{Var}(X + Y) = \text{Var}(X) + \text{Var}(Y)`$ (if $`X`$, $`Y`$ are independent)
4. **BienaymÃ©'s Identity**: $`\text{Var}(\sum X_i) = \sum \text{Var}(X_i)`$ (if independent)

#### Example: Linear Transformation

Let $`Y = 2X + 3`$ where $`X \sim \text{Bernoulli}(0.5)`$:
- $`E[Y] = 2E[X] + 3 = 2 \times 0.5 + 3 = 4`$
- $`\text{Var}(Y) = 2^2\text{Var}(X) = 4 \times 0.25 = 1`$

### Continuous Random Variables

A **continuous random variable** takes on values in a continuous range. These are more complex than discrete variables but are essential for modeling real-world phenomena like measurements, time, and physical quantities.

#### Mathematical Definition

A continuous random variable $`X`$ is a function $`X: \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R}`$ such that:
- The range of $`X`$ is uncountable
- There exists a function $`f_X(x) \geq 0`$ such that:
  ```math
  P(X \in A) = \int_A f_X(x) dx
  ```

#### Intuitive Understanding

Continuous random variables can take on any value in an interval (or union of intervals). Unlike discrete variables, the probability of any specific value is zero. Instead, we work with probability density functions that describe how probability is distributed over intervals.

#### Example: Uniform Distribution

The simplest continuous distribution assigns equal probability density to all values in an interval:
- $`X \sim \text{Uniform}(a, b)`$
- $`f_X(x) = \frac{1}{b-a}`$ for $`a \leq x \leq b`$
- $`f_X(x) = 0`$ otherwise

This models:
- Random selection from an interval
- Rounding errors
- Random number generation

#### Probability Density Function (PDF)

The PDF describes how probability is distributed over the range of the random variable:

```math
f_X(x) = \frac{d}{dx} F_X(x)
```

#### Properties of PDF

1. $`f_X(x) \geq 0`$ for all $`x`$ (non-negativity)
2. $`\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f_X(x) dx = 1`$ (normalization)
3. $`P(X \in A) = \int_A f_X(x) dx`$ (probability of any event)
4. $`P(X = x) = 0`$ for any specific value $`x`$

#### Example: PDF of Uniform Distribution

For $`X \sim \text{Uniform}(0, 1)`$:
- $`f_X(x) = 1`$ for $`0 \leq x \leq 1`$
- $`f_X(x) = 0`$ otherwise

The area under the PDF equals 1, representing total probability.

#### Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)

For continuous random variables, the CDF is the integral of the PDF:

```math
F_X(x) = P(X \leq x) = \int_{-\infty}^{x} f_X(t) dt
```

#### Properties of CDF

1. $`F_X(x)`$ is continuous and non-decreasing
2. $`\lim_{x \rightarrow -\infty} F_X(x) = 0`$
3. $`\lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} F_X(x) = 1`$
4. $`P(a < X \leq b) = F_X(b) - F_X(a)`$
5. $`f_X(x) = \frac{d}{dx} F_X(x)`$ (where derivative exists)

#### Example: CDF of Uniform Distribution

For $`X \sim \text{Uniform}(0, 1)`$:
- $`F_X(x) = 0`$ for $`x < 0`$
- $`F_X(x) = x`$ for $`0 \leq x \leq 1`$
- $`F_X(x) = 1`$ for $`x > 1`$

#### Expected Value

For continuous random variables, the expected value is an integral:

```math
\mu = E[X] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x \cdot f_X(x) dx
```

#### Example: Expected Value of Uniform

For $`X \sim \text{Uniform}(a, b)`$:
```math
E[X] = \int_a^b x \cdot \frac{1}{b-a} dx = \frac{1}{b-a} \cdot \frac{x^2}{2}\Big|_a^b = \frac{a+b}{2}
```

The expected value is the midpoint of the interval.

#### Variance

For continuous random variables:

```math
\sigma^2 = \text{Var}(X) = E[(X - \mu)^2] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} (x - \mu)^2 \cdot f_X(x) dx
```

#### Example: Variance of Uniform

For $`X \sim \text{Uniform}(a, b)`$:
```math
E[X^2] = \int_a^b x^2 \cdot \frac{1}{b-a} dx = \frac{1}{b-a} \cdot \frac{x^3}{3}\Big|_a^b = \frac{a^2 + ab + b^2}{3}
```

```math
\text{Var}(X) = \frac{a^2 + ab + b^2}{3} - \left(\frac{a+b}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{(b-a)^2}{12}
```

#### Moment Generating Function

For continuous random variables:

```math
M_X(t) = E[e^{tX}] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{tx} \cdot f_X(x) dx
```

#### Example: MGF of Uniform

For $`X \sim \text{Uniform}(0, 1)`$:
```math
M_X(t) = \int_0^1 e^{tx} dx = \frac{e^t - 1}{t}
```

#### Properties

1. **Linearity**: $`E[aX + b] = aE[X] + b`$
2. **Additivity**: $`E[X + Y] = E[X] + E[Y]`$ (always true)
3. **Variance**: $`\text{Var}(aX + b) = a^2\text{Var}(X)`$

#### Key Differences from Discrete Variables

1. **Probability of Specific Values**: $`P(X = x) = 0`$ for continuous variables
2. **Probability Density**: We work with density functions instead of mass functions
3. **Integration vs Summation**: Expected values and probabilities involve integrals
4. **Continuity**: CDFs are continuous functions

### Joint Random Variables

When we have multiple random variables, we can study their joint behavior. This is essential for understanding relationships between variables and building multivariate models.

#### Joint PMF (Discrete)

For discrete random variables $`X`$ and $`Y`$:

```math
p_{X,Y}(x,y) = P(X = x, Y = y)
```

#### Joint PDF (Continuous)

For continuous random variables $`X`$ and $`Y`$:

```math
f_{X,Y}(x,y) = \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x \partial y} F_{X,Y}(x,y)
```

#### Example: Joint Distribution

Consider rolling two dice:
- $`X = \text{number on first die}`$
- $`Y = \text{number on second die}`$
- $`p_{X,Y}(x,y) = \frac{1}{36}`$ for $`x, y \in \{1, 2, \ldots, 6\}`$

#### Marginal Distributions

The marginal distributions give the individual distributions of each variable:

**Discrete:**
```math
p_X(x) = \sum_y p_{X,Y}(x,y)
```

**Continuous:**
```math
f_X(x) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f_{X,Y}(x,y) dy
```

#### Example: Marginal Distributions

For the two-dice example:
- $`p_X(x) = \sum_{y=1}^6 \frac{1}{36} = \frac{1}{6}`$ for $`x \in \{1, 2, \ldots, 6\}`$
- $`p_Y(y) = \sum_{x=1}^6 \frac{1}{36} = \frac{1}{6}`$ for $`y \in \{1, 2, \ldots, 6\}`$

Both marginals are uniform distributions.

#### Independence

$`X`$ and $`Y`$ are independent if:

**Discrete:**
```math
p_{X,Y}(x,y) = p_X(x) \cdot p_Y(y)
```

**Continuous:**
```math
f_{X,Y}(x,y) = f_X(x) \cdot f_Y(y)
```

#### Example: Independence

The two dice are independent because:
- $`p_{X,Y}(x,y) = \frac{1}{36}`$
- $`p_X(x) \cdot p_Y(y) = \frac{1}{6} \cdot \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{36}`$

#### Covariance

Covariance measures the linear relationship between two random variables:

```math
\text{Cov}(X,Y) = E[(X - \mu_X)(Y - \mu_Y)] = E[XY] - E[X]E[Y]
```

#### Intuitive Understanding

Covariance measures how two variables change together:
- **Positive**: When one increases, the other tends to increase
- **Negative**: When one increases, the other tends to decrease
- **Zero**: No linear relationship (but variables might still be dependent)

#### Example: Covariance of Independent Variables

For independent $`X`$ and $`Y`$:
- $`E[XY] = E[X]E[Y]`$ (by independence)
- $`\text{Cov}(X,Y) = E[X]E[Y] - E[X]E[Y] = 0`$

Independent variables have zero covariance (but the converse is not always true).

#### Correlation

Correlation is a standardized measure of linear relationship:

```math
\rho_{X,Y} = \frac{\text{Cov}(X,Y)}{\sigma_X \sigma_Y}
```

#### Properties of Correlation

1. **Range**: $`-1 \leq \rho \leq 1`$
2. **Linear Relationship**: $`|\rho| = 1`$ if and only if $`Y = aX + b`$
3. **Independence**: If $`X`$, $`Y`$ independent, then $`\rho = 0`$ (but not conversely)
4. **Scale Invariant**: Correlation is unchanged by linear transformations

#### Example: Perfect Correlation

Let $`Y = 2X + 3`$ where $`X`$ has mean $`\mu_X`$ and variance $`\sigma_X^2`$:
- $`E[Y] = 2E[X] + 3 = 2\mu_X + 3`$
- $`\text{Var}(Y) = 4\text{Var}(X) = 4\sigma_X^2`$
- $`\text{Cov}(X,Y) = E[X(2X+3)] - E[X]E[2X+3] = 2E[X^2] + 3E[X] - E[X](2E[X]+3) = 2\text{Var}(X)`$
- $`\rho = \frac{2\text{Var}(X)}{\sigma_X \cdot 2\sigma_X} = 1`$

#### Properties of Covariance

1. **Symmetry**: $`\text{Cov}(X,Y) = \text{Cov}(Y,X)`$
2. **Linearity**: $`\text{Cov}(aX + b, cY + d) = ac\text{Cov}(X,Y)`$
3. **Additivity**: $`\text{Cov}(X + Y, Z) = \text{Cov}(X,Z) + \text{Cov}(Y,Z)`$
4. **Independence**: If $`X`$, $`Y`$ independent, then $`\text{Cov}(X,Y) = 0`$

#### Example: Covariance Properties

Let $`X`$, $`Y`$, $`Z`$ be random variables:
- $`\text{Cov}(2X + 1, 3Y - 2) = 6\text{Cov}(X,Y)`$
- $`\text{Cov}(X + Y, Z) = \text{Cov}(X,Z) + \text{Cov}(Y,Z)`$

These properties make covariance calculations much easier. 

## Probability Distributions

Probability distributions describe how probabilities are distributed over the possible values of a random variable. Understanding these distributions is crucial for statistical modeling, hypothesis testing, and machine learning.

### Understanding Probability Distributions

Probability distributions are the mathematical models that describe how probability is distributed across the possible values of a random variable. They serve as the foundation for:

1. **Statistical Inference**: Drawing conclusions from sample data
2. **Model Building**: Creating mathematical models of real-world phenomena
3. **Risk Assessment**: Quantifying uncertainty in decision-making
4. **Machine Learning**: Many algorithms assume specific distributions
5. **Quality Control**: Monitoring processes and detecting anomalies

#### Types of Distributions

1. **Discrete Distributions**: For random variables that take on countable values
2. **Continuous Distributions**: For random variables that take on values in continuous intervals
3. **Mixed Distributions**: Combinations of discrete and continuous components

### Discrete Distributions

Discrete distributions model random variables that can take on only specific, countable values. These are often the first distributions students encounter and provide the foundation for understanding more complex continuous distributions.

#### Binomial Distribution

The **binomial distribution** models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials. It's one of the most important discrete distributions with applications throughout statistics and data science.

##### Mathematical Definition

```math
X \sim \text{Binomial}(n, p)
```

##### Probability Mass Function

```math
P(X = k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}, \quad k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, n
```

Where $`\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}`$ is the binomial coefficient.

##### Intuitive Understanding

The binomial distribution answers the question: "If I perform $`n`$ independent trials, each with probability $`p`$ of success, what is the probability of getting exactly $`k`$ successes?"

The formula can be understood as:
- $`\binom{n}{k}`$: Number of ways to choose $`k`$ successes from $`n`$ trials
- $`p^k`$: Probability of $`k`$ successes
- $`(1-p)^{n-k}`$: Probability of $`n-k`$ failures

##### Properties

1. **Support**: $`\{0, 1, 2, \ldots, n\}`$
2. **Parameters**: $`n`$ (number of trials), $`p`$ (probability of success)
3. **Mean**: $`E[X] = np`$
4. **Variance**: $`\text{Var}(X) = np(1-p)`$
5. **Moment Generating Function**: $`M(t) = (pe^t + (1-p))^n`$

##### Derivation of Mean

```math
E[X] = \sum_{k=0}^{n} k \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}
```

```math
= \sum_{k=1}^{n} k \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}
```

```math
= np \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{(n-1)!}{(k-1)!(n-k)!} p^{k-1} (1-p)^{n-k}
```

```math
= np \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \binom{n-1}{j} p^j (1-p)^{n-1-j} = np
```

##### Applications

- **Quality Control**: Number of defective items in a batch
- **Medical Trials**: Number of patients responding to treatment
- **Survey Responses**: Number of "yes" responses in a poll
- **Genetics**: Number of offspring with a particular trait

##### Example: Quality Control

A factory produces light bulbs with a 2% defect rate. In a batch of 100 bulbs:
- $`X \sim \text{Binomial}(100, 0.02)`$
- $`E[X] = 100 \times 0.02 = 2`$ (expected number of defects)
- $`P(X = 0) = \binom{100}{0} 0.02^0 0.98^{100} \approx 0.133`$ (13.3% chance of no defects)
- $`P(X \leq 3) = \sum_{k=0}^3 \binom{100}{k} 0.02^k 0.98^{100-k} \approx 0.859`$ (85.9% chance of 3 or fewer defects)

#### Poisson Distribution

The **Poisson distribution** models the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space. It's particularly useful for modeling rare events and is a limiting case of the binomial distribution.

##### Mathematical Definition

```math
X \sim \text{Poisson}(\lambda)
```

##### Probability Mass Function

```math
P(X = k) = \frac{\lambda^k e^{-\lambda}}{k!}, \quad k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots
```

##### Intuitive Understanding

The Poisson distribution models events that occur independently at a constant average rate. The parameter $`\lambda`$ represents the average number of events in the interval.

The formula can be understood as:
- $`\lambda^k`$: Rate of events raised to the power of observed events
- $`e^{-\lambda}`$: Probability of no events (exponential decay)
- $`k!`$: Normalization factor (number of ways to arrange $`k`$ events)

##### Properties

1. **Support**: $`\{0, 1, 2, \ldots\}`$
2. **Parameter**: $`\lambda`$ (rate parameter, $`\lambda > 0`$)
3. **Mean**: $`E[X] = \lambda`$
4. **Variance**: $`\text{Var}(X) = \lambda`$ (mean equals variance)
5. **Moment Generating Function**: $`M(t) = e^{\lambda(e^t - 1)}`$

##### Derivation of Mean

```math
E[X] = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} k \frac{\lambda^k e^{-\lambda}}{k!}
```

```math
= \lambda e^{-\lambda} \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{\lambda^{k-1}}{(k-1)!}
```

```math
= \lambda e^{-\lambda} \sum_{j=0}^{\infty} \frac{\lambda^j}{j!} = \lambda e^{-\lambda} e^{\lambda} = \lambda
```

##### Applications

- **Arrival Times**: Number of customers arriving at a store
- **Rare Events**: Number of accidents in a time period
- **Radioactive Decay**: Number of particles emitted
- **Network Traffic**: Number of packets arriving at a router

##### Example: Customer Arrivals

A coffee shop averages 10 customers per hour:
- $`X \sim \text{Poisson}(10)`$
- $`E[X] = 10`$ (average customers per hour)
- $`P(X = 0) = \frac{10^0 e^{-10}}{0!} = e^{-10} \approx 0.000045`$ (very unlikely to have no customers)
- $`P(X \leq 5) = \sum_{k=0}^5 \frac{10^k e^{-10}}{k!} \approx 0.067`$ (6.7% chance of 5 or fewer customers)

##### Relationship to Binomial

The Poisson distribution is the limit of the binomial distribution as $`n \rightarrow \infty`$ and $`p \rightarrow 0`$ with $`np = \lambda`$ held constant:

```math
\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty, p \rightarrow 0, np = \lambda} \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} = \frac{\lambda^k e^{-\lambda}}{k!}
```

#### Geometric Distribution

The **geometric distribution** models the number of trials needed to achieve the first success in a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials.

##### Mathematical Definition

```math
X \sim \text{Geometric}(p)
```

##### Probability Mass Function

```math
P(X = k) = (1-p)^{k-1} p, \quad k = 1, 2, 3, \ldots
```

##### Intuitive Understanding

The geometric distribution answers: "How many trials do I need before getting my first success?" It models the waiting time until the first success.

##### Properties

1. **Support**: $`\{1, 2, 3, \ldots\}`$
2. **Parameter**: $`p`$ (probability of success)
3. **Mean**: $`E[X] = \frac{1}{p}`$
4. **Variance**: $`\text{Var}(X) = \frac{1-p}{p^2}`$
5. **Memoryless Property**: $`P(X > n + m | X > n) = P(X > m)`$

##### Applications

- **Quality Control**: Number of items inspected before finding a defect
- **Gambling**: Number of bets before first win
- **Biology**: Number of generations before a mutation appears

### Continuous Distributions

Continuous distributions model random variables that can take on any value in a continuous range. These are essential for modeling real-world phenomena like measurements, time, and physical quantities.

#### Normal (Gaussian) Distribution

The **normal distribution** is the most important continuous distribution in statistics. It's characterized by its bell-shaped curve and has many remarkable mathematical properties.

##### Mathematical Definition

```math
X \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)
```

##### Probability Density Function

```math
f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}
```

##### Intuitive Understanding

The normal distribution is symmetric around its mean and has the characteristic bell shape. The parameters $`\mu`$ and $`\sigma^2`$ control the location and spread of the distribution.

The formula can be understood as:
- $`\frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}}`$: Normalization constant
- $`e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}`$: Exponential decay from the mean

##### Properties

1. **Support**: $`(-\infty, \infty)`$
2. **Parameters**: $`\mu`$ (mean), $`\sigma^2`$ (variance)
3. **Mean**: $`E[X] = \mu`$
4. **Variance**: $`\text{Var}(X) = \sigma^2`$
5. **Moment Generating Function**: $`M(t) = e^{\mu t + \sigma^2 t^2/2}`$
6. **Symmetry**: $`f(\mu + x) = f(\mu - x)`$
7. **68-95-99.7 Rule**: $`P(\mu-\sigma \leq X \leq \mu+\sigma) \approx 0.68`$, $`P(\mu-2\sigma \leq X \leq \mu+2\sigma) \approx 0.95`$, $`P(\mu-3\sigma \leq X \leq \mu+3\sigma) \approx 0.997`$

##### Standard Normal Distribution

```math
Z \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1)
```

```math
f(z) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{z^2}{2}}
```

Any normal random variable can be standardized:
```math
Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}
```

##### Applications

- **Measurement Errors**: Errors in scientific measurements
- **Natural Phenomena**: Heights, weights, IQ scores
- **Central Limit Theorem**: Sums of independent random variables
- **Statistical Inference**: Many tests assume normality

##### Example: Heights

Human heights follow approximately a normal distribution:
- $`X \sim \mathcal{N}(170, 10^2)`$ (mean 170 cm, standard deviation 10 cm)
- $`P(160 \leq X \leq 180) \approx 0.68`$ (68% of people are within 10 cm of mean)
- $`P(X > 190) = 1 - \Phi\left(\frac{190-170}{10}\right) = 1 - \Phi(2) \approx 0.023`$ (2.3% are taller than 190 cm)

#### Exponential Distribution

The **exponential distribution** models the time between events in a Poisson process. It has the remarkable memoryless property.

##### Mathematical Definition

```math
X \sim \text{Exponential}(\lambda)
```

##### Probability Density Function

```math
f(x) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x}, \quad x \geq 0
```

##### Intuitive Understanding

The exponential distribution models waiting times between events that occur at a constant average rate. It's the continuous analogue of the geometric distribution.

##### Properties

1. **Support**: $`[0, \infty)`$
2. **Parameter**: $`\lambda`$ (rate parameter, $`\lambda > 0`$)
3. **Mean**: $`E[X] = \frac{1}{\lambda}`$
4. **Variance**: $`\text{Var}(X) = \frac{1}{\lambda^2}`$
5. **Memoryless Property**: $`P(X > s + t | X > s) = P(X > t)`$

##### Derivation of Mean

```math
E[X] = \int_0^{\infty} x \lambda e^{-\lambda x} dx
```

```math
= \lambda \int_0^{\infty} x e^{-\lambda x} dx
```

```math
= \lambda \left[ -\frac{x}{\lambda} e^{-\lambda x} \right]_0^{\infty} + \lambda \int_0^{\infty} \frac{1}{\lambda} e^{-\lambda x} dx
```

```math
= 0 + \int_0^{\infty} e^{-\lambda x} dx = \frac{1}{\lambda}
```

##### Applications

- **Time Between Arrivals**: Time between customer arrivals
- **Component Lifetimes**: Time until failure of electronic components
- **Radioactive Decay**: Time until particle emission
- **Queueing Theory**: Service times in systems

##### Example: Component Lifetime

A light bulb has an exponential lifetime with mean 1000 hours:
- $`X \sim \text{Exponential}(0.001)`$ (rate = 1/1000)
- $`E[X] = 1000`$ hours
- $`P(X > 500) = e^{-0.001 \times 500} = e^{-0.5} \approx 0.607`$ (60.7% last more than 500 hours)
- $`P(X > 1500 | X > 500) = P(X > 1000) = e^{-1} \approx 0.368`$ (memoryless property)

#### Gamma Distribution

The **gamma distribution** is a generalization of the exponential distribution and models the time until the $`k`$th event in a Poisson process.

##### Mathematical Definition

```math
X \sim \text{Gamma}(\alpha, \beta)
```

##### Probability Density Function

```math
f(x) = \frac{\beta^\alpha}{\Gamma(\alpha)} x^{\alpha-1} e^{-\beta x}, \quad x > 0
```

Where $`\Gamma(\alpha)`$ is the gamma function.

##### Properties

1. **Support**: $`(0, \infty)`$
2. **Parameters**: $`\alpha`$ (shape), $`\beta`$ (rate)
3. **Mean**: $`E[X] = \frac{\alpha}{\beta}`$
4. **Variance**: $`\text{Var}(X) = \frac{\alpha}{\beta^2}`$
5. **Special Cases**: Exponential($`\lambda`$) = Gamma($`1, \lambda`$)

##### Applications

- **Queuing Theory**: Time until kth customer arrives
- **Reliability**: Time until kth component fails
- **Bayesian Statistics**: Conjugate prior for exponential distribution

#### Chi-Square Distribution

The **chi-square distribution** is fundamental in statistical inference, particularly in hypothesis testing and confidence intervals.

##### Mathematical Definition

```math
X \sim \chi^2(\nu)
```

##### Properties

1. **Support**: $`[0, \infty)`$
2. **Parameter**: $`\nu`$ (degrees of freedom)
3. **Mean**: $`E[X] = \nu`$
4. **Variance**: $`\text{Var}(X) = 2\nu`$
5. **Relationship**: If $`Z_1, \ldots, Z_\nu`$ are i.i.d. $`\mathcal{N}(0,1)`$, then $`\sum_{i=1}^\nu Z_i^2 \sim \chi^2(\nu)`$

##### Applications

- **Goodness-of-Fit Tests**: Testing if data follows a hypothesized distribution
- **Variance Tests**: Testing hypotheses about population variance
- **Regression Analysis**: Testing significance of regression coefficients

### Multivariate Distributions

When we have multiple random variables, we need to understand their joint behavior. Multivariate distributions describe how probability is distributed across multiple dimensions.

#### Multivariate Normal Distribution

The multivariate normal distribution is the most important multivariate distribution.

##### Mathematical Definition

```math
\mathbf{X} \sim \mathcal{N}(\boldsymbol{\mu}, \boldsymbol{\Sigma})
```

##### Properties

1. **Marginal Distributions**: Each component is univariate normal
2. **Conditional Distributions**: Conditional distributions are also normal
3. **Linear Transformations**: Linear transformations preserve normality
4. **Independence**: Components are independent if and only if covariance matrix is diagonal

##### Applications

- **Portfolio Theory**: Modeling returns of multiple assets
- **Machine Learning**: Gaussian mixture models, linear discriminant analysis
- **Signal Processing**: Modeling multivariate signals

### Distribution Families

Many distributions belong to families that share common properties and can be transformed into each other.

#### Exponential Family

Distributions in the exponential family have PDFs of the form:
```math
f(x|\theta) = h(x) \exp(\eta(\theta) \cdot T(x) - A(\theta))
```

Members include normal, exponential, gamma, binomial, and Poisson distributions.

#### Location-Scale Family

Distributions in the location-scale family can be written as:
```math
f(x|\mu, \sigma) = \frac{1}{\sigma} f_0\left(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\right)
```

Where $`f_0`$ is the standard form of the distribution.

### Distribution Selection

Choosing the appropriate distribution for a given problem is crucial for accurate modeling.

#### Guidelines

1. **Domain Knowledge**: Use distributions that make sense for the problem
2. **Data Characteristics**: Consider the range, shape, and properties of the data
3. **Mathematical Convenience**: Choose distributions with tractable properties
4. **Goodness-of-Fit**: Test whether the chosen distribution fits the data well

#### Common Choices

- **Count Data**: Poisson, negative binomial
- **Proportions**: Beta, binomial
- **Waiting Times**: Exponential, gamma, Weibull
- **Measurements**: Normal, log-normal, t-distribution
- **Extreme Values**: Gumbel, FrÃ©chet, Weibull 

## Central Limit Theorem

The **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)** is one of the most important results in probability theory and statistics. It explains why the normal distribution is so ubiquitous in nature and provides the foundation for much of statistical inference.

### Understanding the Central Limit Theorem

The CLT states that the sum (or average) of a large number of independent, identically distributed random variables will be approximately normally distributed, regardless of the original distribution of the individual variables.

#### Mathematical Statement

Let $`X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n`$ be independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables with mean $`\mu`$ and variance $`\sigma^2`$. Let $`S_n = X_1 + X_2 + \cdots + X_n`$ be their sum.

Then, as $`n \rightarrow \infty`$:

```math
\frac{S_n - n\mu}{\sigma\sqrt{n}} \xrightarrow{d} \mathcal{N}(0, 1)
```

Or equivalently:

```math
\frac{\bar{X}_n - \mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}} \xrightarrow{d} \mathcal{N}(0, 1)
```

Where $`\bar{X}_n = \frac{S_n}{n}`$ is the sample mean.

#### Intuitive Understanding

The CLT tells us that when we add up many independent random variables, the result tends to look normal, regardless of what the individual variables look like. This is why normal distributions appear so often in natureâmany phenomena are the result of adding up many small, independent effects.

#### Example: Sum of Uniform Variables

Consider adding $`n`$ independent uniform random variables on $`[0, 1]`$:
- Each has mean $`\mu = 0.5`$ and variance $`\sigma^2 = \frac{1}{12}`$
- The sum $`S_n`$ has mean $`n\mu = 0.5n`$ and variance $`n\sigma^2 = \frac{n}{12}`$
- For large $`n`$, $`S_n`$ is approximately normal with these parameters

#### Rate of Convergence

The speed of convergence to normality depends on the original distribution:
- **Symmetric distributions** (like uniform): Converge quickly
- **Skewed distributions** (like exponential): Converge more slowly
- **Heavy-tailed distributions**: May require very large $`n`$

#### Applications

1. **Statistical Inference**: Justifies the use of normal-based confidence intervals and hypothesis tests
2. **Quality Control**: Sums of measurement errors tend to be normal
3. **Finance**: Portfolio returns (sums of individual asset returns) are approximately normal
4. **Signal Processing**: Noise in communication systems is often modeled as normal

#### Example: Sample Mean

If we take the average of $`n = 100`$ independent exponential random variables with mean $`\mu = 2`$:
- The sample mean $`\bar{X}`$ has mean $`\mu = 2`$
- The sample mean has variance $`\frac{\sigma^2}{n} = \frac{4}{100} = 0.04`$
- For large $`n`$, $`\bar{X} \sim \mathcal{N}(2, 0.04)`$

## Practical Applications

Probability theory finds applications across numerous fields and industries. Understanding these applications helps motivate the theoretical concepts and provides practical skills.

#### Monte Carlo Simulation

Monte Carlo methods use random sampling to solve mathematical problems that are difficult or impossible to solve analytically.

##### Basic Idea

1. **Formulate the Problem**: Express the quantity of interest as an expected value
2. **Generate Random Samples**: Create random numbers from appropriate distributions
3. **Compute Estimates**: Use the samples to estimate the quantity of interest
4. **Assess Accuracy**: Use the CLT to construct confidence intervals

##### Example: Estimating Ï

We can estimate $`\pi`$ using Monte Carlo simulation:
1. Generate random points in a square $`[-1, 1] \times [-1, 1]`$
2. Count points that fall inside the unit circle
3. Estimate $`\pi`$ as $`4 \times \frac{\text{points in circle}}{\text{total points}}`$

```python
import numpy as np

def estimate_pi(n):
    x = np.random.uniform(-1, 1, n)
    y = np.random.uniform(-1, 1, n)
    inside = np.sum(x**2 + y**2 <= 1)
    return 4 * inside / n

# Example usage
estimate = estimate_pi(1000000)
print(f"Estimated Ï: {estimate:.6f}")
```

##### Applications

- **Integration**: Computing high-dimensional integrals
- **Optimization**: Finding global minima of complex functions
- **Risk Assessment**: Estimating probabilities of rare events

#### Confidence Intervals

Confidence intervals provide a range of plausible values for an unknown parameter based on sample data.

##### Normal-Based Confidence Intervals

For a sample mean $`\bar{X}`$ from a normal population with known variance $`\sigma^2`$:

```math
\bar{X} \pm z_{\alpha/2} \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
```

Where $`z_{\alpha/2}`$ is the $`(1-\alpha/2)`$ quantile of the standard normal distribution.

##### Example: Mean Estimation

Suppose we have a sample of $`n = 25`$ observations with $`\bar{x} = 10.5`$ and known $`\sigma = 2`$:

- 95% confidence interval: $`10.5 \pm 1.96 \times \frac{2}{\sqrt{25}} = 10.5 \pm 0.784 = [9.716, 11.284]`$
- We are 95% confident that the true population mean lies in this interval

##### t-Based Confidence Intervals

When the population variance is unknown, we use the t-distribution:

```math
\bar{X} \pm t_{\alpha/2, n-1} \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
```

Where $`s`$ is the sample standard deviation and $`t_{\alpha/2, n-1}`$ is the critical value from the t-distribution.

#### Hypothesis Testing

Hypothesis testing provides a framework for making decisions about population parameters based on sample data.

##### Basic Framework

1. **Null Hypothesis** $`H_0`$: The default assumption
2. **Alternative Hypothesis** $`H_1`$: What we want to show
3. **Test Statistic**: A function of the data that measures evidence against $`H_0`$
4. **p-value**: Probability of observing data as extreme as what we saw, assuming $`H_0`$ is true
5. **Decision**: Reject $`H_0`$ if p-value < significance level $`\alpha`$

##### Example: One-Sample t-Test

Test whether the mean of a population differs from a hypothesized value $`\mu_0`$:

- $`H_0: \mu = \mu_0`$
- $`H_1: \mu \neq \mu_0`$
- Test statistic: $`t = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu_0}{s/\sqrt{n}}`$
- Under $`H_0`$, $`t \sim t_{n-1}`$ (t-distribution with $`n-1`$ degrees of freedom)

##### Type I and Type II Errors

- **Type I Error**: Rejecting $`H_0`$ when it's true (false positive)
- **Type II Error**: Failing to reject $`H_0`$ when it's false (false negative)
- **Power**: Probability of correctly rejecting $`H_0`$ when it's false

#### Bayesian Inference

Bayesian inference provides an alternative framework for statistical inference that incorporates prior knowledge.

##### Bayesian Framework

1. **Prior Distribution**: $`p(\theta)`$ - our beliefs about the parameter before seeing data
2. **Likelihood**: $`p(x|\theta)`$ - probability of observing data given the parameter
3. **Posterior Distribution**: $`p(\theta|x) = \frac{p(x|\theta)p(\theta)}{p(x)}`$ - updated beliefs after seeing data

##### Example: Coin Tossing

Suppose we want to estimate the probability $`p`$ that a coin lands heads:

- **Prior**: $`p \sim \text{Beta}(2, 2)`$ (symmetric, centered at 0.5)
- **Data**: 7 heads in 10 tosses
- **Likelihood**: $`\text{Binomial}(10, p)`$
- **Posterior**: $`p \sim \text{Beta}(9, 5)`$ (conjugate prior)

The posterior mean is $`\frac{9}{14} \approx 0.643`$, which combines our prior belief with the data.

#### Machine Learning Applications

Probability theory is fundamental to many machine learning algorithms.

##### Naive Bayes Classifier

A simple but effective classifier based on Bayes' theorem:

```math
P(y|x) = \frac{P(x|y)P(y)}{P(x)} \propto P(x|y)P(y)
```

The "naive" assumption is that features are conditionally independent given the class.

##### Gaussian Mixture Models

A flexible model for clustering that assumes data comes from a mixture of normal distributions:

```math
f(x) = \sum_{k=1}^K \pi_k \mathcal{N}(x|\mu_k, \Sigma_k)
```

Where $`\pi_k`$ are mixing weights that sum to 1.

##### Hidden Markov Models

Models for sequential data where the underlying state is hidden:

- **States**: Hidden variables that follow a Markov chain
- **Observations**: Visible variables that depend on the current state
- **Applications**: Speech recognition, bioinformatics, natural language processing

## Practice Problems

### Problem 1: Probability Calculations

**Objective**: Practice basic probability calculations and understand the relationship between different probability concepts.

**Tasks**:

2. Use conditional probability to solve complex problems
3. Apply Bayes' theorem to update beliefs with new evidence
4. Verify independence and dependence of events

**Example**: In a standard deck of 52 cards, what is the probability of drawing:
- A heart or a face card?
- A heart given that the card is red?
- Two aces in a row (without replacement)?

### Problem 2: Distribution Fitting

**Objective**: Learn to identify appropriate distributions for different types of data and fit them to real datasets.

**Tasks**:
1. Generate or collect data from various sources
