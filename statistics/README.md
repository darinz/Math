A comprehensive guide to statistical concepts, methods, and Python implementations for artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science applications.

## File Formats

This repository provides content in two complementary formats:
- **Markdown (.md)**: Theoretical foundations with mathematical explanations and concepts
- **Python (.py)**: Practical implementations with detailed code examples and educational annotations

The markdown files contain the theoretical foundations, while the Python files provide comprehensive implementations with detailed explanations, visualizations, and practical applications.
