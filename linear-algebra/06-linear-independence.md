# Linear Independence and Basis

## Introduction

Linear independence and basis are fundamental concepts that determine the structure and dimension of vector spaces. Understanding these concepts is crucial for solving systems of equations, performing coordinate transformations, and analyzing data in machine learning. In ML, the concepts of independence and basis underlie feature selection, dimensionality reduction, and the expressiveness of models.

### Why Linear Independence and Basis Matter in AI/ML

1. **Feature Selection**: Redundant features are linearly dependent; removing them improves model efficiency
2. **Dimensionality Reduction**: PCA finds a new basis of independent directions (principal components)
3. **Model Expressiveness**: The basis determines the space of possible solutions
4. **Coordinate Systems**: Changing basis is essential for understanding embeddings and transformations

## Linear Independence

A set of vectors $`\{v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n\}`$ is linearly independent if the only solution to:
```math
c_1 v_1 + c_2 v_2 + \cdots + c_n v_n = 0
```
is $`c_1 = c_2 = \cdots = c_n = 0`$ (the trivial solution).

### Mathematical Definition
Vectors $`v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n`$ are linearly independent if:
- The equation $`c_1 v_1 + c_2 v_2 + \cdots + c_n v_n = 0`$ has only the trivial solution
- No vector in the set can be written as a linear combination of the others
- The rank of the matrix $`[v_1\ v_2\ \ldots\ v_n]`$ equals $`n`$

**Geometric Interpretation:**
- In $`\mathbb{R}^2`$, two vectors are independent if they are not collinear
- In $`\mathbb{R}^3`$, three vectors are independent if they do not all lie in the same plane
- In $`\mathbb{R}^n`$, $`k`$ vectors are independent if they span a $`k`$-dimensional subspace

**Why It Matters:**
- The maximum number of linearly independent vectors in a space is its dimension
- Basis vectors must be linearly independent
- In ML, linearly dependent features do not add new information

### Testing Linear Independence

**Method 1: Row Reduction**
1. Form the matrix $`A = [v_1\ v_2\ \ldots\ v_n]`$ with vectors as columns
2. Row reduce to echelon form
3. If rank equals $`n`$, vectors are independent

**Method 2: Determinant**
- For $`n`$ vectors in $`\mathbb{R}^n`$, compute $`\det(A)`$
- If $`\det(A) \neq 0`$, vectors are independent
- If $`\det(A) = 0`$, vectors are dependent

**Method 3: Gram-Schmidt Process**
- Apply Gram-Schmidt to the vectors
- If any vector becomes zero, the original set is dependent

**Numerical Considerations:**
- Use tolerance for floating-point comparisons
- Check condition number of the matrix
- Consider using SVD for numerical stability

## Basis

A **basis** for a vector space $`V`$ is a linearly independent set that spans $`V`$.

### Properties of a Basis
1. **Linear Independence**: All vectors in the basis are linearly independent
2. **Spanning**: Every vector in $`V`$ can be written as a linear combination of basis vectors
3. **Minimal**: No proper subset spans $`V`$
4. **Unique Representation**: Each vector has a unique representation in terms of the basis

**Mathematical Definition:**
A set $`\{v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n\}`$ is a basis for $`V`$ if:
- The vectors are linearly independent
- $`\text{span}\{v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n\} = V`$

**Geometric Interpretation:**
- In $`\mathbb{R}^2`$, any two non-collinear vectors form a basis
- In $`\mathbb{R}^3`$, any three non-coplanar vectors form a basis
- The standard basis for $`\mathbb{R}^n`$ is $`\{e_1, \ldots, e_n\}`$

**Why It Matters:**
- The basis provides a coordinate system for the space
- Dimensionality reduction (PCA) finds a new basis for the data
- The number of features in ML is the dimension of the feature space
- Change of basis is fundamental in many ML algorithms

### Standard Basis
The standard basis for $`\mathbb{R}^n`$ is $`\{e_1, e_2, \ldots, e_n\}`$ where:
```math
e_i = (0, 0, \ldots, 1, \ldots, 0)
```
with 1 in the $`i`$-th position and 0 elsewhere.

**Properties:**
- Each $`e_i`$ is orthogonal to all other $`e_j`$ for $`i \neq j`$
- $`\|e_i\| = 1`$ for all $`i`$
- Any vector $`v = (v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n)`$ can be written as $`v = \sum_{i=1}^n v_i e_i`$

## Coordinate Systems

### Vector Representation in Different Bases

The concept of representing vectors in different bases is fundamental to linear algebra and has profound implications in machine learning. When we represent a vector in different bases, we're essentially changing our "coordinate system" or "perspective" for describing the same mathematical object.

**Mathematical Foundation:**
Given a vector space $`V`$ with basis $`B = \{b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n\}`$, any vector $`v \in V`$ can be uniquely written as:
```math
v = c_1 b_1 + c_2 b_2 + \cdots + c_n b_n
```

The coefficients $`c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_n`$ are called the coordinates of $`v`$ with respect to basis $`B`$, denoted $`[v]_B`$.

**Key Properties:**
1. **Uniqueness**: Each vector has exactly one representation in a given basis
2. **Completeness**: Every vector can be represented in any basis
3. **Linearity**: The coordinate mapping preserves vector operations

**Geometric Interpretation:**
Think of changing bases as changing the "ruler" or "measuring stick" we use to describe vectors. Just as we can describe a location using different coordinate systems (Cartesian, polar, etc.), we can describe vectors using different bases.

**Applications in ML:**
- **Feature Transformations**: Changing the basis of feature space
- **Embeddings**: Word embeddings, image embeddings represent data in new bases
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Finding optimal bases for data representation

## Change of Basis

### Change of Basis Matrix

The change of basis transformation is a fundamental operation that allows us to convert between different coordinate representations of the same vector space. This is crucial in machine learning for feature transformations, dimensionality reduction, and understanding data from different perspectives.

**Mathematical Foundation:**
Given two bases $`B_1`$ and $`B_2`$ for vector space $`V`$, the change of basis matrix $`P`$ satisfies:
```math
[v]_{B_2} = P^{-1}[v]_{B_1}
```

where $`[v]_{B_1}`$ and $`[v]_{B_2}`$ are the coordinate representations of vector $`v`$ in bases $`B_1`$ and $`B_2`$ respectively.

**Construction of P:**
The $`i`$-th column of $`P`$ is the coordinate representation of the $`i`$-th basis vector of $`B_2`$ in the basis $`B_1`$:
```math
P = [[b_2^{(1)}]_{B_1}\ [b_2^{(2)}]_{B_1}\ \ldots\ [b_2^{(n)}]_{B_1}]
```

**Key Properties:**
1. **Invertibility**: $`P`$ is always invertible
2. **Composition**: $`P_{1 \to 2} \cdot P_{2 \to 3} = P_{1 \to 3}`$
3. **Identity**: $`P_{1 \to 1} = I`$

**Geometric Interpretation:**
The change of basis matrix $`P`$ tells us how to "rotate" or "transform" our coordinate system. Each column of $`P`$ represents the coordinates of the new basis vectors in the old basis.

**Applications in ML:**
- **Feature Engineering**: Transforming features to new coordinate systems
- **Data Preprocessing**: Normalizing and standardizing data
- **Model Interpretability**: Understanding model decisions in different bases

## Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization

### Orthogonal Basis

The Gram-Schmidt process is a method for converting a set of linearly independent vectors into an orthogonal (or orthonormal) set that spans the same subspace. This is fundamental in machine learning for creating orthogonal features, implementing QR decomposition, and building orthogonal bases for numerical stability.

**Mathematical Foundation:**
Given linearly independent vectors $`v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n`$, the Gram-Schmidt process constructs orthogonal vectors $`u_1, u_2, \ldots, u_n`$ as follows:

```math
\begin{align}
u_1 &= v_1 \\
u_2 &= v_2 - \text{proj}_{u_1}(v_2) \\
u_3 &= v_3 - \text{proj}_{u_1}(v_3) - \text{proj}_{u_2}(v_3) \\
&\vdots \\
u_k &= v_k - \sum_{i=1}^{k-1} \text{proj}_{u_i}(v_k)
\end{align}
```

where $`\text{proj}_u(v) = \frac{\langle v, u \rangle}{\langle u, u \rangle} u`$ is the projection of $`v`$ onto $`u`$.

**Key Properties:**
1. **Preserves span**: $`\text{span}\{u_1, u_2, \ldots, u_n\} = \text{span}\{v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n\}`$
2. **Orthogonality**: $`\langle u_i, u_j \rangle = 0`$ for $`i \neq j`$
3. **Uniqueness**: The orthogonal set is unique up to scaling

**Geometric Interpretation:**
Gram-Schmidt is like "straightening" a set of vectors. We start with the first vector, then "subtract out" the component of each subsequent vector that lies in the direction of the previous orthogonal vectors, leaving only the "perpendicular" component.

**Numerical Considerations:**
- Accumulate roundoff errors can cause loss of orthogonality
- Use modified Gram-Schmidt for better numerical stability
- Check orthogonality condition: $`|\langle u_i, u_j \rangle| < \epsilon`$ for $`i \neq j`$

## Applications in Machine Learning

Linear independence and basis concepts are fundamental to many machine learning algorithms and techniques. Understanding these concepts helps us design better features, reduce dimensionality, and improve model performance.

### Feature Selection and Dimensionality Reduction

**Mathematical Foundation:**
In machine learning, we often work with feature matrices $`X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}`$ where $`n`$ is the number of samples and $`d`$ is the number of features. Linear dependencies among features can cause:

1. **Multicollinearity**: Features that are linearly dependent can cause numerical instability in regression models
2. **Redundant Information**: Dependent features don't add new information
3. **Overfitting**: Models may fit to noise in dependent features

**Key Concepts:**
- **Feature Rank**: The rank of the feature matrix determines the maximum number of linearly independent features
- **Feature Selection**: Choosing a subset of linearly independent features that preserve the most information
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Reducing the number of features while maintaining model performance

**Methods for Feature Selection:**
1. **Correlation Analysis**: Remove highly correlated features
2. **Variance Threshold**: Remove low-variance features
3. **Recursive Feature Elimination**: Iteratively remove least important features
4. **L1 Regularization**: Promote sparsity in feature selection

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

**Mathematical Foundation:**
PCA finds an orthogonal basis for the data that maximizes variance along each direction. The principal components are the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix, ordered by their corresponding eigenvalues.

**Algorithm:**
1. Center the data: $`X' = X - \bar{X}`$
2. Compute covariance matrix: $`C = \frac{1}{n-1} X'^T X'`$
3. Find eigenvectors: $`C v_i = \lambda_i v_i`$
4. Project data: $`Y = X' V`$ where $`V`$ contains the top eigenvectors

**Key Properties:**
1. **Orthogonality**: Principal components are orthogonal to each other
2. **Variance Maximization**: Each component captures maximum variance in the remaining directions
3. **Dimensionality Reduction**: We can truncate to $`k`$ components while preserving most variance

**Geometric Interpretation:**
PCA finds the "natural" coordinate system for the data. The first principal component points in the direction of maximum variance, the second in the direction of maximum variance perpendicular to the first, and so on.

**Applications:**
- **Data Visualization**: Reducing high-dimensional data to 2D/3D for plotting
- **Noise Reduction**: Removing components with low variance
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features from principal components

### Linear Independence in Neural Networks

**Mathematical Foundation:**
In neural networks, linear independence is crucial for:
1. **Weight Matrix Rank**: Ensures the network can learn diverse representations
2. **Feature Learning**: Independent neurons learn different features
3. **Gradient Flow**: Prevents vanishing/exploding gradients

**Key Concepts:**
- **Weight Matrix Conditioning**: Well-conditioned weight matrices have independent rows/columns
- **Feature Diversity**: Independent neurons capture different aspects of the data
- **Regularization**: Techniques like dropout promote independence

**Methods for Promoting Independence:**
1. **Orthogonal Initialization**: Initialize weights to be orthogonal
2. **Regularization**: Use L2 regularization to prevent weight collapse
3. **Dropout**: Randomly zero neurons to promote independence
4. **Batch Normalization**: Normalize activations to improve conditioning

### Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

**Mathematical Foundation:**
SVD decomposes a matrix $`A`$ as:
```math
A = U \Sigma V^T
```

where $`U`$ and $`V`$ are orthogonal matrices and $`\Sigma`$ is diagonal.

**Applications in ML:**
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Truncated SVD for feature reduction
- **Recommendation Systems**: Matrix factorization for collaborative filtering
- **Image Compression**: Low-rank approximations
- **Text Analysis**: Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA)
