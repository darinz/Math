- Numerical methods
- Machine learning applications (gradient descent, backpropagation)

### [Linear Algebra](linear-algebra/)
Essential linear algebra concepts with practical implementations:
- Vector and matrix operations
- Linear transformations and eigenvalues
- Vector spaces and matrix decompositions
- Applications in dimensionality reduction and neural networks
- Numerical linear algebra methods

### [Statistics](statistics/)
